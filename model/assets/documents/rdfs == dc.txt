ex:hasSinger rdfs:subPropertyOf ex:hasPerformer .
This means that if a subject and object are related by the ex:hasSinger predicate, they must also be related by the ex:hasPerformer predicate.

Two important facts about any property are its domain and range, which constrain the resources that can be employed in subject and object position when the property is used as a predicate; these can also be defined using RDFS resources, as follows:
ex:hasSinger rdfs:domain mo:Performance .
ex:hasSinger rdfs:range foaf:Agent .
This means that any resource occurring as subject of ex:hasSinger must belong to the class mo:Performance (only performances have singers), while any resource occurring as object of ex:hasSinger must belong to the class foaf:Agent (only agents are singers).

RDFS entailment rules
The RDFS entailment regime is defined by thirteen rules, which are listed here. In brief, their import is as follows:
rdfs1
Allocates a blank node to a literal, and classifies this node as a member of the class rdfs:Literal.
rdfs2
Uses a rdfs:domain statement to classify a resource found in subject position (in a triple containing the relevant property as predicate).
rdfs3
Uses a rdfs:range statement to classify a resource found in object position (in a triple containing the relevant property as predicate).
rdfs4
Classifies a resource found in subject or object position in a triple as belonging to the class rdfs:Resource.
rdfs5
Inference based on the transitivity of rdfs:subPropertyOf.
rdfs6
Infers that any resource classified as a property is a sub-property of itself.
rdfs7
Uses a rdfs:subPropertyOf statement to infer that two resources are related by a property P if they are related by a subproperty of P.
rdfs8
Infers that any resource classified as a class is a subclass of rdfs:Resource.
rdfs9
Infers that a resource belongs to a class if it belongs to its subclass.
rdfs10
Infers that any class is a subclass of itself.
rdfs11
Uses the transitivity of rdfs:subClassOf to infer that the subclass of a class C is a subclass of the superclass of C.
rdfs12
Infers that any resource belonging to rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty is a subproperty of rdfs:member.
rdfs13
Infers that any resource belonging to rdfs:Datatype is a subclass of rdfs:Literal.
In what follows, we look more closely at how these RDFS resources and their associated rules can support inferences when information is retrieved from a dataset.
